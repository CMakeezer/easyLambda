Currently, it contains unit tests for accuracy and performance of various
mapreduce units, meta helper classes and readFile algorithm.

The tests use asserts (Perhaps can be changed to some library, later).

For building the testcases run `make unitTest` from the project directory.
On successfull compilation run `./bin/unitTest`.
