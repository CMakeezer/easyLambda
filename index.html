<div>
EasyLambda is a header only C++14 high-performance library for processing data 
streams in parallel with functional list operations (map, filter, reduce, scan, zip)
that are tied together in type-safe data-flow. It has declarative interface with 
novel column selection for better composition of functions, provides
MPI parallelism without any parallel details in user code, provides generic 
algorithms for I/O and frequently used computations on data to make data-processing
with C++ easy and fast.
</div>
<p>
The parallelism is implicit by the semantics of data-flow and map-reduce
and can be controlled as a declarative property of an operation. The
interface of the library is minimal and non-redundant. The library scales well
to hundreds of processes in a HPC cluster, on multiple cores on a single CPU,
on cloud cluster and incurs little overhead on a serial run. The same program
can be run in any of the architecture without any changes.
</p>
<p>
Programming with pure functional data-flow is similar to the way we think in
spreadsheet programs, SQL queries or declarative commands like gawk, 
cut etc, without any restrictions (you can apply any C/C++ function to data columns).

The site aims to be a
comprehensive guide for easyLambda such that a C / C++ programmer of any level
of experience can follow the material and get started using easyLambda.
